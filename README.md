A [React.js](https://react.dev/) project bootstrapped with [Vite.js](https://vitejs.dev/).

Meaning 'The Joy of the Gospel,' this Bible study web application is paired with a generative AI companion to create discussion questions based on verses from the Gospels. The GPT model is structured to pose questions referencing the commentary of Catholic Church Fathers found in St. Thomas Aquinas' [*Catena Aurea*](https://books.google.com/books/about/Catena_Aurea.html?id=jo2UszqxPt4C&printsec=frontcover&source=kp_read_button&hl=en&newbks=1&newbks_redir=1).

## Abstract

The rapid advancements in generative artificial intelligence have sparked theological discussions regarding its role in society and its implications for humanity. This project explores the intersection of AI and theology by proposing a complementary rather than competitive relationship between humans and machines. The study examines AI’s potential in fostering engagement in religious practices, particularly with Scripture through a Bible study web application. The application employs OpenAI’s GPT-4o mini model to generate questions for biblical reflection and comprehension based on provided passages. The findings suggest that while generative AI is not a substitute for community discussion, it can serve as a valuable tool to enhance individual engagement with Scripture. These results highlight the importance of the integration of AI tools as a support mechanism rather than a substitute for human participation in religious practices.
